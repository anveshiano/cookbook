# Physical and environmental security

## Secure areas

### Physical security perimeter

There are two security perimeters that affect our operations:
1. Our London office
2. The locations of the Amazon Web Services datacentres that run our remote
   servers

### Physical entry controls

In our London office requires the use of swipe cards in order to access the
building, our floor and our corridor. More information is available
[here](https://help.wework.com/hc/en-us/articles/212962043-What-security-measures-does-WeWork-have-in-place-to-protect-members-and-their-property)

### Securing offices, rooms and facilities

However, our office room itself does not
have any access controls. Therefore it is our policy to never leave the room
unlocked if there is not at least one other team member in the room.

In case of any office related emergencies, the WeWork emergency hotline can be
found

### Working in secure areas

Secure areas for us are:
* Our employees' homes
* Our London office

Whenever we are not in one of these secure areas we must:
* respect the
[off-premesis](#security-of-equipment-and-assets-off-premises) policy.

### Security of equipment and assets off-premises

We often work in puclic places. This because
* some members of our team work remotely from shared office spaces
* we travel regularly to meet our clients and can work in transit

In order to avoid any security breaches:
* we never show and/or type passwords and access keys when others can see our
  screen
* we never leave our devices unattended in public places

### Secure disposal or reuse of equipment
