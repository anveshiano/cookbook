# 1Password Usage

During onboarding, you will be provided with a company-licensed 1Password vault for storing your passwords. You must use this for DVELP accounts. This includes using the 1Password password generator to create secure passwords.

Storing login credentials for DVELP accounts anywhere other than 1Password is prohibited.

Please note that although the 1Password account is licensed by DVELP, your personal vault is completely private to you.

For guidance on using and getting the most out of 1Password, please see [their website](https://support.1password.com/explore/get-started/).
